# Capstone-Project---Python
**Overview** : The Python Capstone Project focused on developing an end-to-end data analytics solution that automated the processing, cleaning and analysis of complex employee and project datasets. The project implemented business rules to compute bonuses, promotions and performance metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making through structured logic and insightful reporting.
Using Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy, the workflow handled large volumes of raw data, corrected inconsistencies and optimized tabular structures for efficient analysis. Derived insights were summarized into clear, actionable reports to help highlight patterns in employee productivity and organizational performance.

**Key Features**: 
- Data Cleaning and Validation: Automated detection and correction of missing, duplicate, and inconsistent records.
- Business Logic Automation: Added rule-based computations to calculate bonuses, performance ratings and promotion eligibility.
- Data Transformation: Utilized pandas operations for grouping, filtering and aggregating complex datasets.
- Performance Insights: Generated summary tables and reports consolidating metrics like employee efficiency, tenure impact and project outcomes.
- Statistical Computation: Integrated variance, mean, and correlation analysis to interpret employee and project-level trends.
- Report Optimization: Delivered results in structured Excel and CSV formats for easy managerial review.

**Tools & Technologies Used**
Python: Core language for scripting, computation and automation.
pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation, transformation and numeric computation.
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Development and analysis environment.
Excel: Used for preliminary data exploration and report export.
